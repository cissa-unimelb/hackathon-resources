### [Carbon and Energy](https://github.com/cissa-unimelb/hackathon-resources/blob/main/2022-tracks/carbon-and-enegry.md)
Global carbon emissions have become an increasingly prominent problem and little has changed in the way our world handles energy storage and production. This track is everything related to bolstering clean energy sources and reducing carbon emissions. Hackers are encouraged to brainstorm ideas on how to promote cleaner transportation, optimise energy usage within the home, inform people about carbon emissions, and promote renewable energy sources.

### [Waste](https://github.com/cissa-unimelb/hackathon-resources/blob/main/2022-tracks/waste.md)
The resource production of the modern world is nothing like anything history has witnessed. This drives our comfortable lives but also results in unprecedented waste production. This track is all about utilising technology to reduce our impact on the environment. Hackers are urged to formulate ideas on how to bolster recycling, reduce usage of products with harmful waste, lessen the consumption of single use items and promote composting.

### [Food and Nutrition](https://github.com/cissa-unimelb/hackathon-resources/blob/main/2022-tracks/food-and-nutrition.md)
Obesity and diet related health issues are a prominent problem and food production takes its toll on the earth. This track prompts for technology to be employed to assist people to adjust to a healthier lifestyle for them and for the earth. Hackers are prompted to create solutions to inform people about the benefits of a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle, make this lifestyle more accessible and ensure they are able to maintain it.
